## Dev notes -

- Prompt for chatbot - "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the context provided. You use previous history messages, reference them to answer the questions"

- Prompt for extracting user details = "Extract key details about the user from the following conversation. Focus only on information that might be relevant for future interactions, such as user preferences, opinions, recurring topics, important context, and any explicitly stated facts about the user. Do not summarize the conversationâ€”only list extracted details concisely."
